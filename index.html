      <h3>The Early Years</h3>
      <p>
      
         Ralph Dale Earnhardt was born on April 29, 1951, in Kannapolis, North Carolina. His father, Ralph Earnhardt, was a successful race car driver and renowned mechanic, and Dale developed a love for cars at an early age. Dale made his stock car racing debut in May of 1975, finishing 22nd in the World 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway. 
         <br>
         <br>
         Earnhardt signed his first full-time Winston Cup contract with Rod Osterlund for the 1979 season. That year, Earnhadt won his first race on the NASCAR circuit at the Southeastern 500 in Bristol, Tennessee and was awarded NASCAR’s Rookie of the Year.

      <h3>A Career of Success</h3>
      <p>
         Earnhardt won his first cup championship in 1980 and the following year signed to race for Richard Childress Racing. In 1983 his career took off, recording four wins in 1985, five in 1986, and 11 in 1987 and back to back cup championships in ’86 and ’87.

         <br>
         His success on the track continued, as he won his fourth championship in 1990 and his fifth in 1991. After a disappointing 12th place finish in 1992, Earnhardt bounced back the following year to win a sixth championship. In 1994 he clinched his seventh championship with a win at the AC Delco 500 in his home state of North Carolina. With his seventh championship Earnhardt tied legendary driver Richard Petty for most career titles.

      <h3>Unexpected Death</h3>
      <p>
         Known for being extremely loyal, Earnhardt stayed true to his roots to the very end. Nearing the end of the Daytona 500 in 2001, with only his son Dale Jr. and teammate Michael Waltrip ahead of him, his car was clipped from behind and sent into the outside wall. This accident killed Earnhardt on impact and truly shocked the racing world.
